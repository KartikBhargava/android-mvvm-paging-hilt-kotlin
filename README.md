Android MVVM architecture example in kotlin using data-binding library,Room and Dagger-2

This example demonstrates MVVM architecture implementation in Android using data-binding library with Room persistence library and Dagger-2 in Kotlin. Example follows SOLID principles and includes management of local and remote data through DataManager class. 

In future updates I am planning to add one shared ViewModel class between activity and associated fragments.
